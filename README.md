Description
----------------------

CwisarDH+ is a background detection method for RGBD videos based on a weightless neural system, 
namely WiSARD, with the aim of exploiting its features of being highly adaptive and 
noiseâ€“tolerance at runtime.
In CwisarDH+, the changing pixel colors and depth in a RGBD video are processed by an incremental 
learning neural network with a limited-in-time memory-retention mechanism that allow the
proposed system to absorb small variations of the learned model (background) 
in the steady state of operation as well as to  fastly adapt to background 
changes during the video timeline.

Compile/Run CwisarDH+ source (Linux, Mac OSX)
----------------------

To run the code the following libraries are required:

1. OpenCV 3.0 (later versions may also work)

2. CMake  3.0  (later version may also work)

3. C++ Compiler (tested only with GCC 5.x or later versions)

```
$ cmake .
$ make
$ cwisardhplus  -P <RGBDvideo-folder>
```

CwisarDH+ has been implemented to participate in the SBM-RGBD Challenge @ RGBD2017 (http://rgbd2017.na.icar.cnr.it/SBM-RGBDchallenge.html). As a prerequisite to use correctly this software you need to format your input RGBD video according to the format decided by the SBM-RGBD Challenge organizers. In more details, your <code><RGBDvideo-folder></code> must have the following structure/contents:

```
<RGBDvideo-folder>/depth              # folder for depth images of the video
<RGBDvideo-folder>/groundtruth        # folder for groundtruth images for perfromance meausures
<RGBDvideo-folder>/input              # folder for color images of the video
<RGBDvideo-folder>/ROI.bmp            # bitmap Region-Of-Interest image 
<RGBDvideo-folder>/temporalROI.txt    # one-line text file (<startidx> <endidx>) indicating frist and last frame index used for measurements

```
